      <h2>Daily Challenge 4/2/25</h2>
      <p>I would rather sleep in a bath full of custard, because it would definitely be a good snack and thick enough to just lay there and not drown. In the morning I yell " yikes " squash" my hand has a squash in it. I got out of the custard bath after a great sleep and my earrings are missing and realize they must have fallen into the bath, then I reach in to find my earrings but i only grab bags of fur, then I give up and go to school covered in custard and falling down the stairs.</p>

      <h2>Taking Responsibility</h2>
      <p>I say that social media companies shouldn't be held responsible for cyberbullying on their platforms because they may have made it but they can't control what people say or do on said websites. Most of the responsibility is towards the user for saying those racist and inappropriate words, but you can put some of the blame on the companies because they can restrict some of these words said in chats and other groups. In some companies, there are restrictions that they have put in but there is one specific place that has no good left and it's got everything you will ever need but that is a place you shouldn't go because that place is Reddit. My final decision is that most of the responsibility goes toward the users for saying everything they do because they can not say it. Meanwhile, the companies could put some restrictions or blocks on stuff you can tell others online.</p>
