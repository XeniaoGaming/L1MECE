      <p> This is my about me page. It will consist of my interest and hobbies</p>
      <br>
      <h3> Interests: </h3>
      <p> I enjoy playing Video Games such as Minecraft, Team Fortress 2,Ark Survival Evoled, Hydroneer, Phasmophobia, Raft, Motorcycle Mechanic Simulator 2021 (MMS21) and Dying Light.
        <br>
       I love to watch Anime some of my personal best are; Solo Leveling, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Campione, Sword Art Online, Spirit Chronicles, Arifureta and Berserk Of Gluttony.
       <br>
       I would die to drive cars right now but it's illegal so whenever I get the chance to drive on our property it is a real fun time. When i'm older I want to be riding Motorcycles.  </p>
       <br>
       <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
       <p> My favourite hobby has to be Sea Scouts just because of the sailing, rowing and other skills we learnt over years.
         <br>
         More hobbies of mine are fishing, LEGO, Black Jack, Poker and Golf
